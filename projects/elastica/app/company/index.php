				<h1>What’s in the name?</h1>
				<p>Elastic:  <i>“..flexible, accommodating, adaptable, buoyant..”</i>.  So shall we say the corollary to  Darwin’s thesis for Enterprises is that ‘Only the ones who are the most Elastic would survive’.  </p>

<p>Elastic Enterprise is now about flexibility in how employees are enabled to use most efficient  cloud services and mobile, to stay agile and competitive.  Security is often the deterrent to such flexibility.  Elastica solves the cloud security problem to enable your Elastic Enterprise.</p>
