        may be chosen. Potential winners will have won the prize subject to their fulfillment of all requirements under
        the Rules. Potential winners will be asked to complete, sign and return Sponsor’s Prize Claim Documents
        defined below. Once returned fully executed and verified by Sponsor, Sponsor will declare the entrant to be
        a winner. <strong>The odds of winning depend on the total number of Entries received.</strong>

        <br/>
        <strong>Disqualification.</strong> At the sole discretion of the Sponsor, disqualification, and forfeiture may result from
        any of the following (collectively “Disqualified”) and an alternate winner selected as described herein:
        <strong>[1]</strong> potential winner’s failure to timely respond to notification of being selected as a winner, or to any
        other communication sent to the potential/winner, within twenty-four (24) hours or such other time if
        explicitly provided by Sponsor; <strong>[2]</strong> potential winner’s failure to provide Sponsor with satisfactory proof
        of age, identity, residency or other eligibility as may be requested; <strong>[3]</strong> potential winner’s failure to
        validly claim any prize; and <strong>[4]</strong> any other non-compliance with Rules. In the event the potential winner
        is Disqualified, Sponsor will make at least two subsequent attempts to award that Prize by selecting
        alternate, potential winners in accordance with the above procedure, after which the Prize in question
        may at Sponsor’s sole discretion, go un-awarded. If Sponsor believes, in its sole discretion, that a
        legal issue presents a significant problem related to awarding a prize to a selected entrant, another
        entrant will be selected instead if possible.

        <br/>
        <strong>Answering Mathematical Skill Question.</strong> If a potential winner is a resident of Canada, Mexico, any
        country in the Asia-Pacific or Japan (“APJ”) region, or other jurisdiction where the promotion is
        similarly prohibited, then as a condition of receiving the Prize, the selected potential winner may
        be required to correctly answer a mathematical skill question, asked verbally by telephone. The
        question must be answered within five minutes, and without the benefit of any assistance (including

        right (except where contrary to federal, state, or local laws or regulations) to substitute a prize in
        whole or in part with another prize of comparable or greater value if the intended prize or any portion

        </p>

        <p>
        <strong>6. GENERAL PRIZE CONDITIONS:</strong> Prior to awarding any prize, Sponsor, in its sole
        discretion, may require potential winners to sign and/or return an affidavit of eligibility,

        within ten (10) days of prize notification and receiving such Prize Claim Documents (or a shorter time
        if required by exigencies), except where prohibited by applicable law, may cause the prize to be
        forfeited and potentially awarded to an alternate as solely determined by the Sponsor.
        Except with respect to any warranty issued by the Prize manufacturer, Prizes are awarded without
        warranty of any kind, express or implied, without limitation. WITHOUT LIMITING THE GENERALITY OF THE
        FOREGOING, SUCH PRIZES ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,

        up to a maximum of the ARV of each Prize as stated above for/toward the Prizes, but may expend less

        Sponsor for/toward the Prizes and the Prizes' ARV above. Winners are responsible for all costs and other
        expenses associated with winning or acceptance of the prize that are not specifically mentioned herein.
