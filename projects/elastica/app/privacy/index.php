                </p>

                <h3>HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION</h3>

                <p>

                </p>

                <p>
                We use cookies and log file information to: (a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the Website; (b) provide custom, content and information; (c) monitor the effectiveness of our Website; (d) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors and traffic; (e) diagnose or fix technology problems reported by our users or engineers that are associated with certain IP addresses; and (f) help you efficiently access information.
                </p>

                <p>
                By providing Elastica your email address or other contact information, you consent to our using such contact information to communicate with you regarding the Website, Elastica products and solutions. You also consent to our using your email address to send you Website-related notices, including any notices required by law, in lieu of communication by postal mail. We may also use your contact information to send you other messages, such as newsletters, changes to features of the Website, or special offers. If you correspond with us by email, we may retain the content of your email messages and our responses.
                </p>

                <p>
                Any personal information or content that you voluntarily disclose for posting to the Website’s forums, message boards or similar publicly accessible areas becomes available to the public. Elastica is not responsible for personally identifiable information and data contributions that you choose to disclose publicly on the Website.

                <h3>HOW WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION</h3>

                <p>
                Elastica does not share your personally identifiable information with other, third-party companies for their commercial or marketing use. As we develop our business, we may buy or sell assets or business offerings. Customer, email, and visitor information is generally one of the transferred business assets in these types of transactions. We may also transfer such information in the course of corporate divestitures, mergers, or dissolution.
                </p>

                <p>
                Except as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy, Elastica will not disclose personal information to any third party unless required to do so by law or subpoena or if we believe that such action is necessary to (a) conform to the law, comply with legal process served on us or our affiliates, or investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities; (b) to take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend ourselves against any third- party claims or allegations, to assist government enforcement agencies, or to protect the security or integrity of our Website or the Elastica Products; and (c) to exercise or protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Elastica, our Elastica Product users or others.
                </p>

                <p>
                We may share non-personally identifiable information (such as anonymous usage data, referring/exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.) with interested third parties to help them understand the usage patterns for the Website.
                </p>

                <p>
                We may store personal information in locations outside the direct control of Elastica (for instance, on servers or databases co-located with hosting providers).
                </p>

                <h3>YOUR CHOICES ABOUT YOUR INFORMATION</h3>

                <p>
                You may, of course, decline to submit personally identifiable information through the Website, in which case Elastica may not be able to provide certain services to you.
                </p>

                <h3>CHILDREN’S PRIVACY</h3>

                <p>
                Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. For that reason, Elastica does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13. If you are under 13, please do not send any information about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, or email address. No one under age 13 is allowed to provide any personal information to or on Elastica’s Website. In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us at info@elastica.net.
                </p>

                <h3>LINKS TO OTHER WEBSITES</h3>

                <p>
                We are not responsible for the practices employed by websites linked to or from our Website, nor the information or content contained therein. Please remember that when you use a link to go from our Website to another website, our Privacy Policy is no longer in effect. Your browsing and interaction on any other website, including those that have a link on our Website, is subject to that website’s own rules and policies. Please read over those rules and policies before proceeding.
                </p>

                <h3>NOTIFICATION PROCEDURES</h3>

                <p>
                It is our policy to provide notifications, whether such notifications are required by law or are for marketing or other business related purposes, to you via email notice, written or hard copy notice, or through conspicuous posting of such notice on our Website, as determined by Elastica in its sole discretion. We reserve the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications to you.
                </p>

                <h3>CHANGES TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY</h3>

                <p>
                If we change our privacy policies and procedures, we will post those changes on our Website to keep you aware of what information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances we may disclose it. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.
