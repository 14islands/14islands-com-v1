// Set on wrapper div around responsive image to prevent reflows after image loads
// Note: Parent of wrapper needs to have same width as image or ratio will be wrong (so u might need 2 extra divs around the image)
@mixin responsive-ratio($width, $height) {
	height: 0;
	padding-bottom: $height / $width * 100%;
}
